To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee

"You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of viewâ€¦ Until you climb inside of his
skin and walk around in it."

Set in the Deep South, the story follows young Scout Finch as her father Atticus defends a black man unjustly accused
of a terrible crime. The novel explores themes of justice, prejudice, and moral growth.
