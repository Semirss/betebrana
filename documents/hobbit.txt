The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien

In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy
smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that
means comfort.

Bilbo Baggins never expected to leave his cozy home, but when a company of dwarves arrives with a wizard named Gandalf,
his adventure begins.
